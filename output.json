Edit the transcript from the YouTube video and upload it, and if a problem arises while uploading, delete it.\n\nOnce uploaded, I must be sure to save my transcription. The transcript file is a ZIP file of the audio stream as displayed on YouTube, and your phone should then be able to stream from any cellular Internet connection, anywhere in the world.\n\nUpload your transcript to my website's transcript database. You can download the whole file for free from my transcript data website.\n\nYou can download your transcript from any database, including our own transcription databases, and print out transcripts.\n\nMake the transcript as large as possible to be easily uploaded elsewhere.\n\nMake it available online, so you will be able to share your transcript as you wish, and others can use it as well.\n\nFor best results if your uploaded transcript takes approximately a minute or so to load (we'll add your transcript to our list, when it loads), it is unlikely that you will hear anything after you upload. When you have heard in real time some parts of your conversation, and know how far it went before the call ended and how long it has gone since you picked up your cellphone, you should be able to get a good idea of how long each line was longer than the one that you were on - and why they were on long lines.\n\nIf your recorded call begins during a break during the call, we will let you know, and ask for some suggestions on which voice and which microphone to choose to improve your performance. By default, our voices will get the largest amount of attention, and the longest to load up each page. We can hear from a distance as well.\n\nIf you have trouble with connecting to your phone, check that your Bluetooth or Wi-Fi card will not allow any external microphone: if you have an external microphone, it can interfere with your recording and the sound of the transcript.\n\nYou can upload the transcript in several formats - it can either be a single line of your conversation using a particular phone, or four lines, using your Bluetooth microphone. Uploading for your own recordings will have the biggest possible impact overall - if you have four consecutive calls, you should be able to get a good transcript about half as large as the single line, or 4 lines as large.\n\nIt is probably best for you to upload an uploaded transcript on your own, because once uploaded you need to make the transcript available",

He hadn't violated any income taxes and hadn't been following any sales or sales-specific guidelines. But this time around, he hadn't followed rules for sales and had gone through a complicated process, and the letter got sent to everyone in his household…because it was his online persona who had created the marketplace.\n\nSo, when we received a threatening letter, we were nervous. We were afraid of being labeled as bad actors and put in the same boat as several million others. It was just not practical to respond immediately when one of your own had been targeted—nor was practical to create an email signature if we didn't have a working email system.\n\nThat was why we knew that if people knew that people who use your program were sending messages to the person who used your email system or that your program was sending out instructions to that person, they're less likely to respond. So, in effect, if you're a startup that has a lot of users, you're going to have a hard time getting these kinds of responses. You've got to figure out a way to manage people's interactions and create what we refer to as the \"user story.\"\n\nYou need a story. How would that story be different with Car Sales?\n\nFor the customer story, we've got a lot of people who are interested in buying a Car. They want to know what their options are. We want to build trust and make them feel safe again in the buying process. We want them to know where they should go buy their car…what they should expect to pay to do an average repair, and all of that.\n\nWhat about their income history? How would we get that information? It's kind of an interesting issue since so many people don't understand how their income relates to whether a seller or buyer should pay for their car.\n\nWhat you need to do, rather than just saying, \"Hey Car Sales is going to send you the customer's history as part of its process to be able to provide more specific guidance about what to price people for or the sales cost,\" you have to work a little bit in a little bit",

Because Routine maintenance information is provided by independent sources, the identity of the independent experts assisting with use of Routine Maintenance remains confidential. An incident reports and other pertinent information may be obtained through a hospital system to determine whether the risk of infection resulting from using hospital-supplied Routine maintenance is greater than that of one authorized medical personnel to maintain that same patient in the emergency clinic setting.\n\nRoutine maintenance personnel should maintain confidentiality of the source of their expert knowledge.

The transcript must have at least 20 minutes of calls per hour and must be available to any customer who uses the program. No customer or operator-side transcriber or other authorized user may initiate any other kind of sales activity without first obtaining the approval of the Consumer Advisory Committee of the Consumer Council of Canada, which provides advice on consumer affairs in the United States. See the Federal Trade Commission(1) Rules of Practice for Transcribers and Traders, Chapter 17(a)(i), or consult the Canada Revenue Agency(2) General Information on Transcribers.\n\nTo use the program, a transaction must include a price that includes the retail value of the goods or services provided by the customer under that transaction. The price must then include VAT based on the total value of the services provided and the value paid by each client and, for the services that are not for resale, not more than the value of the goods or services. A value-based method of calculating the retail value of the goods or services provided must be used on all orders. A value-based approach is only applied when there is a large difference in value based on size of the package, brand, content, or other factors or that a transaction is to be made in which the value of the goods or services is higher in value or in other ways than under the value-based approach. Value differences are not applied if no such difference exists.\n\nThe following are examples of value-based methods that may be applied to sales:\n\nFixtures delivered for sale are usually subject to price adjustments. A purchaser of a product may receive additional merchandise by placing more orders. For example, if the purchaser receives 3 different items, he may decide to order a box of candles and one box of lighters as the total items. As a result of the addition of the additional items, the total order price may have increased by approximately 30% to reflect this. The total order price may increase if the purchaser had not placed any additional orders in any order. If an order is re-shipped, the total cost may be reduced by less than the retail value of the items for which the item was used. A service or goods purchased for resale are not value-based, and are not subject to the change in the prices of items described above. Any difference or change in the value of such a purchase due to the rehandling is an amount that is treated as loss of value",

As a result any other devices using RTC must be configured to listen to these commands.

There's an update on our efforts. This afternoon's reports about the fire is correct. Two crews of crews went out at approximately 10:22 a.m. to an area in order to deal with the flames that are out there.\n\nSteve Tandy: So there's an update, and there's been other reporting today. We still do not have a plan for evacuating any of the people out of the buildings. Two crews were still engaged. But there's a fire with a 200-foot hose on top of it that is at 200 or 225 degrees. I believe they should clear the building a little bit more since that's coming out of the top of the building. I've never dealt with that kind of fire until today. I've never seen a fire that size.\n\nSteve Tandy: We are working and we still don't have a clear plan for evacuating any of the people out of the buildings. Once you have that fire under control, we'll have a different plan. And the plan is still to protect the public by going out right away.\n\nSteve Tandy: In this particular case, if any evacuees are in the building and, in fact, the fire is already under control and the public evacuation would go forward, it would be done in a way that allows for all the possible people out of the buildings. We'll have to wait and see where that fire goes.\n\nSteve Tandy: The fire control crew worked in concert with the fire engine company in terms of getting the fire controlled for as many hours as they could because it was so close to the building. For you, with the engine you're able to get that much time, and the fire is not out yet, what kinds of procedures would you say go through the engines so they don't get stuck, particularly since the city already says its evacuations will start at 7 a.m. today in the area?\n\nStephen Tandy: Yeah, and I have a few questions for you, Steve Tandy. Two hours ago, you said, \"At this point it's just the fire crews that'll be dealing with the firefighters. But the engineers know the information and know what they're doing right now so they can be in an emergency.\" What actually happens has",

I know, I saw you selling one car for a car, like you are selling two cars now, why? Why sell one car? Why? So. We talk, we get ideas\" - Martin O'Neill\n\nSelling two cars simultaneously to separate buyers is almost always a very risky proposition. You may need the money to cover legal, insurance and gas costs once there are three months running between the sale and delivery. You could end up paying all or over $100K for one car plus some of that gas, insurance, registration and dealer fees before getting paid. The other risk a buyer faces is finding out in less than a minute what items you have sold, after selling the car yourself. Not to be too optimistic about a sale there is a high chance you must give some sort of discount or discount credit for both of the new cars.\n\nIn that case, you may be doing a double-dealer with both cars. Or maybe you don't even need the deal to go any further than a simple sale. After all, with many used cars you will get to use the service as well. But remember, these transactions have to go through a third party which will usually require a deposit to get the service. At least I don't feel that necessary for most of these situations since there are usually many other ways that you can improve a service so that the company is happy to accept the cash.\n\nWhat to do with each car\n\nAfter you pick up the finished product be sure the seller will hand over a receipt so that a dealer can check the credit and insurance of the new cars. If you do not accept that part of getting the new car, don't take on the car itself, as most dealers do not want the new car on their lot either.\n\nYou may want to call an independent vehicle dealer as they may need a list of the cars sold. If you are in the US, you can check with auto sales at online car service providers to see what your options really are (this will require a service agreement). You can also find a car service provider to look at if that is your only option, and ask questions to get their opinion. You can also check with another online car service provider to see if you have any options beyond buying and selling cars.\n\nOne final thing, keep the car",

Learn about our low-income student loan options.\n\nGet free money off some of your student loans:\n\nIf you don't qualify for a low-interest student loan, you don't have to worry about paying back the principal. Your loan repayment terms might be shorter for those with a lower loan balance, a good credit score, and an excellent job record.\n\nThese terms usually depend on your loan amount and your borrower, so you'll want to talk with your college to see how much each amount of income the institution uses for your loan.\n\nFind out more about how much your loans might go back on your records on this page:\n\nIncome or Credit Rating?\n\nDepending on your credit score, and whether or not you have an existing, high-interest student loan, you can find ways to lower your debt for free and improve your credit score.\n\nFor example, the Federal Student Aid website allows you to add a \"high credit balance\" category to your loan information. And by signing up for their free credit monitoring service, your credit history is kept in the public record for 30 days, to let you know if any of these negative things have become a problem. And for people with negative credit scores, their existing high balances can be turned into a monthly credit repair charge that can help lower your debt load or decrease your monthly payments.\n\nFree Student Loans by the Year\n\nStudent loans account for about 37 percent of all federal student loans held by students in the U.S.\n\nYou can earn between $2,851 and $27,945 per year on average with your student loan money\n\nYou can earn $50,000 per year",

This is useful to detect a problem in a program that uses complex sequences when multiple tests should be repeated. You'll use this function:\n\nint get-rtc ( char *, int, int, char *, int ) { if ( int ) { char * s [ 6 ] ='' ; p_rtc_t t ; for ( int v1 = 0 ; v1 < 5, v2 = 0 ; v2 < 7 ; v2++ ) { if ( v1 >= 10 && v2 >= 20 || v1 >= 15 || v1 >= 20 ) { t = ( char * ) p_rtc_get_t ( s, v2, p_rtc_get_t ( s, 0, & t [ 2 ])); if (* t has data ) continue ; if (* t has 0 bytes ) continue ; t += 12 ; } } else if (( char * ) & s [ 3 ]!='\\0') { t += 12 ; } p_rtc_put_t ( s, * p_rtc_get_t ( s, 0, & t [ 4 ])); if (* t has data ) continue ; char * q = p_rtc_gets ( s ); if (* q!= 0 ) goto continue ; char * i = p_rtc_islen ( q ); continue ; while ( (( char * ) p_rtc_free64 ( q [ 0 ])!= NULL ) && * (( char * ) p_rtc_free64 ( q [ 1 ])!= NULL )!= NULL ) { p_rtc_free ( q [ 1 ]); t += 6 ; } } return * t ; }\n\nYou should then rerun get-rtc without the calls to p_rtc_get_t and then you should use char arrays to store the resulting code and test it for memory integrity.\n\nIf your program fails because of an error with the pointer type the program might be able to be traced using the program index. Using an array of a variable length is a good way to locate an unreachable function.\n\nHere is a list of possible types of variables:\n\nint\n\nchar*\n\nchar\n\nchar\n\nchar\n\nchar\n\nchar\n\nchar\n\nchar*\n\nchar\n\nchar*\n\nchar*\n\nchar*\n",

Use our transcripts to get access to your voicemail or emails, and see where your call came from.\n\nTranscripts can also help you get more information from the person you are talking to. If you have a specific question, for example, in a hurry, listen for a tone tone type response and send or receive a transcript. For more call information, check out our Call Log guide.\n\nThe call logs, phone numbers, and content of a call on the internet are often incomplete and difficult to search through. We also sometimes see many transcriptions of a specific interview. If you do a small search on Facebook, you may see them as people ask questions, or use Google, Bing, Yahoo, or other site to seek answers to their questions in different formats.\n\nTo see the phone numbers, we recommend searching for \"scraped\" or \"cracked\" phone numbers in Internet search results. Scraped phone numbers are phone numbers that have been disconnected from our system and are not recorded but can be received in the system through our online system. These may be phone numbers on the internet accessible only to those with a specific phone number entry on the website.\n\nTo do this, search for \"phone calls with your contact by default\" in all of the Google search result titles, and then choose \"Scrap phone numbers.\" The most helpful results will turn you into phone book junkies who go to great care in trying to find your phone numbers, or you can use our Find my Number tool to send multiple phone numbers via text message with a specific phone number entry in it.\n\nYou can also call each others in-person and look up your contact information to get back an accurate number. This is also a great way to receive your voicemail while on the road, although we don't recommend the use of this tactic with this system right after driving.\n\nWe use both a transcript and a paper transcript to get back the names of all phones and calls, and it is extremely helpful and useful when looking up other information the caller mentioned or shared.

Click on the 'Call Box' label and select either 'Car Wash' or 'Wedding' as your type, depending on which method you are creating the call from. The Call Box should only have a 'Car Wash' label if the listener wants to send a text message about it, and an 'Wedding' label for audio recording. Check the box next to the method that makes the call as described above.\n\nYou will have to make adjustments to your existing server settings to make sure that the above instructions are enough to get your client to start listening for your podcast. Make sure that 'Auto-Start Recording' is off. To check what Auto-Start Recording is on, open up your podcast client's preferences and check the box next to Auto-Start Recording: This shows that Auto-Start Recording will be disabled by default, but can be turned on when you are done. You can turn it off via your server's preferences, or add a service property that allows you to turn on it.\n\nNext, create the call handler in a file named 'callhandler' somewhere on your server. This file will contain the code of how you want to deal with the listener. In most cases you will have already implemented everything in your class, so create your newly created file by writing:\n\nclass CarHandler<T>(T callback): name, __name__ = 'CarHandler', email = lambda self: self.name + '', phone = lambda self: self._dial.get_phone().get_number() def on_enter(self): self.name = self.email(\"C.J, Hello!\") self.phone = self._dial.get_local() @callback def on_dial(self): self.dial_id = self._dial.dial_number return self, self.name @callback def on_phone(self): self._dial.get_local() self._dial_id = self._dial.dial_number return self.dial_id def __call__(self): callhandler_handler(0) if __name__ == \"__main__\": CarHandler_0()\n\nThe above file should look something like this:\n\nNow, add the code to the following file, and save it:\n\nfrom",

This is a separate time limit: when you start to sell clothing at a certain time, you can no longer be at a different place than where it is now. You should not sell the clothes, except at the point where the time limit is no longer valid.\n\nI take care of this task all the time: to find an inventory number, to pick a place to store the collection, to check to make sure to pay attention to conditions, etc.\n\nIn this example from the book, I took it for three consecutive days. Since there was no time constraint I didn't sell any clothes: when you are selling clothes it is very easy to forget one of them. I could carry out all this work almost entirely in my own time. After three days I put it all on the paper and passed it to the sales team so they could finish it.\n\nIf the sales team sees it they are able to buy it without any problems. This is the first example in which the person being led is really doing something, not just repeating what you say. If you want to tell an intelligent but non-verbal person what a seller is doing, go talk to your salesmen and ask them to be so, for example, you need to get them to buy a particular amount of something. For example, a salesperson who has a very strong background will quickly get to know you. At this point you will probably know what the other people's names are: a sales person is not going to trust someone with such a large amount of personal information at his fingertips. You need to be careful about giving a salesperson personal information.\n\nThis is also when the sales team will have the opportunity to help you. If you find that you do not communicate as much as you say you are you can send him your copy of the call transcript. On the other hand, if you are selling to someone who wants to sell you something, then you can help them get more items done.\n\nYou can write about the sale on your blog or at a press conference.

This is handy if you need to get a list of locations that are selling cars.\n\nExample of one of my notes: \"A neighbor has been selling cars to my boss who can give me a full list of the cars sold from that neighborhood, as well the dates they have been sold.\" This is a good way to ensure that you receive at least an address list for your sales.\n\nWhat to do with a listing in an email?\n\nIf you purchase a new car, you'll receive an update. If not, the email or message is not to be used. All of the details of the sales will be available to you once the car is transferred to your new owner. But you may need to know:\n\nWhen the car was first sold as a vehicle in your name;\n\nWhy you bought and who offered to sell it to you;\n\nCurrent credit ratings;\n\nInformation about the credit needs and the cashflow needed to pay the car's down payment;\n\nIf you have any liens or insurance claims;\n\nWhen your car had any problems when you owned it; and,\n\nThe identity of the buyer of the vehicle that purchased it. This may be important if the car was underpaid by a large number of people before you left your name on the list, may have been sold to someone else or was stolen. Or if your last name isn't on the list.\n\nThe only caveat is if you don't list the selling address on your car-auction record when you buy it, you'll be charged a high \"Fee & Taxes\" fee if you leave something that you don't list on your registration and credit report. This fee reflects a 5% sales tax due on each new car. See How to Report a Property Sale for more information.\n\nBut if you have a registered car, you can still add it to your email list of buyers. Be sure to list the name of your car dealer on your transaction so you're listed there when you report a loss.\n\nContact your local car-auction dealers to fill out the proper information you'll need in order to send your car to them. If you are selling a used vehicle in your name, you must have the vehicle certified by the IRS. If you aren't sure when you can buy a car, ask your financial services company.\n\nWhen Your Local Car-Auction Site Does the Listing",

She said everyone was; everyone else was walking on their own. This woman walked down the street with her dog as if she could catch her breath or if she had a panic attack. (I was just going to call it a week?)\n\nShe told me something I would remember: \"I had a very scary thought – someone might have gotten onto my bed and started hurting me.\"\n\nWe started our story because that is something everybody will experience sometimes: a thought to put into words or an experience that makes a difference in someone's life. Some people think of it like reading a book or a piece of literature: you can read the meaning (some people are better at this), but the reality sometimes does not. That is when it becomes more of a person's reality and less of just a thought.\n\nThere is more to the way our memories work than just an emotional response to something, says Brian Gough. He is a psychologist and author of The Great Debating: The Mental and Emotional Evolution of Thought, Reason and Language and The Mind at Play, about whether it takes more time in one area to make a shift in how people think, feel and react — or whether it is all a collective action.\n\nWhy am I not afraid to ask my wife if she knows of my nightmares?\n\nGough wants us more to be honest and not try to find fault with something for which we do not even believe in. There is simply a lot we do not know we do not know. But if we look back at history, there's little evidence that our memories can be trusted as objective guides.\n\n\"Historical evidence often shows that for the most part the memory is biased when it comes to explaining events of recent past,\" says Gough. \"For example, recall can be very helpful or the memory can reflect an earlier event but not a later one.\"\n\nGough points to a study conducted in 2007 that followed more than 600 students across three years in which a few days of recall made huge differences in how they remembered past events, such as the first day of",

As long as the United States oil industry produces more oil than it consumes, an oil supply surplus exists for some time into the future. According to most conservative estimates the United States can expect to produce over 300,000,000 barrels a day, by 2025. This quantity of oil will then need to be diverted into the process of developing alternative sources of energy, which presently accounts for about 15%.\n\n\"The United States cannot avoid meeting these demands through either overt or covert action.\"\n\n\"The U.S. oil industry alone will demand an initial amount of 1,900,000 barrels a day by 2015, which will rise to 1,600,000 or 1,700,000 barrels a day by 2017 when it is projected to be close to surplus. At this rate the United States is planning to produce nearly 2.5m barrels of oil, an amount sufficient to meet the supply requirements of an emergency.\n\n\"At just under 1 percent the cost to the United States of operating the existing infrastructure must be roughly the same as that of the current domestic oil supply.\"\n\nThe link also says to: \"We are already close to the threshold needed to meet the current world production needs in any given year. The world oil demand is expected to rise by between 5 and 10 percent by 2015 before eventually leveling off again. The US economy is projected to be close to the production threshold by 2021.\n\n\"We are expecting the market response to this market demand to be strong and rapid. It remains to be seen whether or not major changes in the regulatory environment will result from what the industry terms the 'new beginning.' But the time is past and today's meeting is clearly an important one which must be a wake-up call to the U.S. decision makers.\"",

To the extent that her campaign can find a way to exploit this, Obama's allies might well decide to give their tacit support to her campaign.\n\nWhile there are many ways to spin everything, I'd encourage everyone to look for an easy narrative. For instance, Obama would never support a \"radical Islamic terrorist\" like ISIS – because it would only embolden those who were already radicalized and potentially a domestic terrorist in their own right. He would never support Assad – that would open the door to U.S. involvement and lead to a global terrorist state.\n\nHe could end aid to the so-called rebels in Libya \"to fight ISIS,\" and end direct support to the so-called rebels in Syria (since there they are going to fight as well, if only we can convince them to cooperate with us).\n\nHe could, at the same time, use ISIS to promote his own narrative. Maybe it was this strategy that worked in Libya, which enabled his coup in 2011:\n\nThen the coup in Egypt failed, and the military went on with its coup, even after losing the national elections that year—an outcome that was not only predictable, but also part of the \"reasons we had done the right thing.\" In such a strategy, a \"good\" political outcome can be reduced to the mere fact that the military \"turned against us,\" as is now being widely used as evidence for any policy initiative they may pursue. In this strategy, an independent judiciary and independent media is a key to creating good government.\n\nOr Obama could simply use ISIS to undermine American standing with his people in the Middle East (a ploy we have employed twice in Syria):\n\nAnd then there is the prospect of a limited-war intervention to help \"moderate\" rebels in Libya, without even having to go to war. With Hillary Clinton as president, the U.S. would have a much tougher time winning over the world",

If you don't know what it is, please refer to the FAQ: FAQ:8.1)\n\nYou can generate and read transcripts for more than one call, but remember to keep a clean code and file for each. It's recommended that you create a separate file per call, in case they go through each other or some of the calls need to be re-written. See the \"Generated transcripts\" section for more information.\n\nNote: If you're calling from a networked mobile device and you're connected to that network, try not to use a phone number where it's the phone's fault.\n\nIn some situations, the PUT and DELETE methods can't complete because you're calling from some other program at that specific time. For instance:\n\nIt's probably impossible to handle the case where you're calling from two separate processes.\n\nIf you're doing PUT and DELETE operations concurrently and your application is busy while the first thread goes through the routine(s), there will be no time to handle those calls before the first thread has taken the final action. In such a case, you can pause the first thread, and the second thread can try to resume.\n\nYou could try to start the program on a device that doesn't have an audio device connected at all. This is especially appropriate if the phone calls on that device come from somewhere other than the phone, but you still want to call from a different phone. The exception to that rule is when the phone is connected to a PC and your program is using it as your primary source of data. This is generally only for emergency use.\n\nIn some cases, you probably want to avoid calls that start with \"UUID=xxxxxxxxxxx\", because it's hard to identify with an actual UUID. If you're calling from one device to another, it's a good idea to use the UUIDs that are generated (as in the \"generated transcript\" example) to identify the device that will handle the call.\n\n8.2 Calling from another code location\n\nTo call from different code locations that contain your program, you can simply use the.call() method or write your own method.

This may mean your landline company provides a 3G or 4G signal, and sometimes you won't be able to connect to your PC or laptop with a cellular phone, especially if you've been using an Internet wireless plan. We use a computer called a workstation or phone that we often name \"Apple\" or \"Windows Phone.\"\n\nWe also run a computer called \"Google\" that runs some repair products and software to assist with troubleshooting.\n\nIf you already have a good cell phone with a 5.96 megapixel camera, you can access the repair site at repairsupport.com by simply logging onto your computer from the desktop. (In addition, if your phone has a camera so you don't have to install a separate camera app, or if a Windows 7 computer is connected to your phone.)\n\nNote:",

To illustrate how this impacts U.S. oil supplies it is more appropriate to look at Canada, whose national crude oil exports rose over six percent in 2015 over the year before, largely reflecting rising domestic consumption, according to Oil Change International. For example, a Canadian rig, the Brent oil rig, is expected to deliver its ninth load with the newly constructed Marcellus Shale field this coming week, raising production by 8 percent over 2015. U.S. crude oil exports are expected to more than double in 2016, to $45 billion. In addition, the U.S. has been expanding its current contract of 25 Brent deliveries with the Bakken region of North Dakota. By its own measurement, 2014 was the third straight year U.S. crude oil exports reached record highs, up more than 50 percent from year-ago levels, and U.S. crude oil exports to North Dakota are estimated to surpass $10/bbl by season's end, or 11 percent of Canadian exports.\n\nThe U.S. is also producing, on average, more than 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil for each barrel of natural gas consumed, and, though oil consumption remains a relatively low driving force, natural gas is the primary fuel for producing pipelines across the country and the result of a combination of rising oil prices, better pipelines and higher use from wind and solar projects. For example, according to the US Department of Energy, renewable energy generated an additional 13,900 megawatt hours of electricity in 2014, the fourth consecutive year of more than double-digit growth, and wind power capacity grew at 11 percent per year.\n\nAt the same time, it is fair to say that overall domestic oil production is down about 22,000 barrels per day since 2007, a decrease that is largely caused by a surge in shale resource recovery in shale plays across the U.S. The U.S. is the only country in the world to depend heavily on oil from unconventional sources, and shale oil extraction by the private sector has been increasing significantly over the last several years. By 2014, more than a quarter of all U.S. oil production was from unconventional sources; only Saudi Arabia had more.\n\nU.S",

We have then run this algorithm in practice and we have learned that when we define a function based on RegData it is able to detect even small differences in the calls of this function. So imagine this function as a speech recognition engine that can detect your voice and provide you with audio that is very informative.\n\nNote that I use 'a' here to distinguish between a variable and a variable.\n\nIn the following section we will apply a RegData approach to a very simple example of an NLP task called FindKeyLiteralPatterns. The sample code, extracted from the Github repo, reads:\n\nclass FindKeyLiteralPatterns<U Int> : public NLPJob, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, void> {... } class FindKeyLiteralPatternsAhead(TJobRecord):...... class FindKeyLiteralPatternsAheadAhead(TJobRecord):......... constexpr def f(T: T): U = 10 def f(U: U): U = 1... } class FindKeyLiteralPatternsInNLPCase1: void {... } class FindKeyLiteralPatternsInNLPCase2: void {... } class FindKeyLiteralPatternsInNLPCase3a: //...\n\nWhat do we learn by examining the example in detail?\n\nFirst of all we have seen that RegData automatically identifies variables, that when our code calls, we receive a new object representing the variable. We now know that, by our code's own logic we could modify it by making a new variable with different semantics; we would not need to use the normal methods of object literals and the data of variable types such as U or Uint16.\n\nThis allows us to take advantage of the capabilities of machine learning to get more accurate predictions. The interesting part is that, when this NLP job looks for words in English, the RegData approach identifies words that do not exist in English by using a small set of words.\n\nWe have built a model from RegData that does exactly the same thing, and as such it can",

It's not really much more than a text based transcript, which is fine for use when you are with friends or family who use the app. If you do want to copy the transcript or even the audio, and then use Call transcript to call a friend who is in need of help getting off the phone, or find your mom or boyfriend or spouse or whatever...well, it should work for just about anybody.\n\nIt actually works really well, which is why I use it. I'm so sorry for the lack of audio-only transcript, but that is, as I said, a great application for when you want to communicate in one voice with someone who already knows what you are talking about. In fact, I'm hoping, with something like this, someday we will have a voicephone without sound, because then, honestly, when you're driving while using this voicephone app, no one knows you're trying to make a call.\n\nNow, for this one...well...you can download it here. It sounds fine, but as you said earlier, if you just don't have the audio, which I suspect most likely you do--so we'll use audio for anything but the transcript we are going to talk about--\n\nIf you want to take the transcript for the first 2 minutes of a 6-minute call before turning to a video or audio format, you'll have to purchase the Car sales app from iTunes or Google Play. Again, if you have not done so already because you don't want to bother with Apple, that option is there. So, if Apple and Google decide on this platform, there will be a way to purchase copies of the transcripts, and so they will do so, because there will also be a way to also use Call transcript for things like a call in your car, or a call at home, or a call to an emergency number.\n\nSo, I know there are a lot of questions about this, so let me ask some of them. First off, just some basic guidelines about how this is going to work. These transcripts will only work with Car sales, so you won't really be receiving any calls that are connected. If you turn off support for Car sales, you won't be able to make a call with this app.\n\nBut at this point, on all sides,",

(We've used this call to give you some handy tips and advice, including how to make yourself feel like you're a real person without using \"he,\" \"her,\" \"their,\" or something that sounds like a pronoun.)\n\nFor this 8-minute call, you may want to bring along:\n\nA phone book containing all the digits associated with your region\n\nThe local government phone service ID number\n\nWhether or not you're using public-safety emergency service, you might want to bring some cash; it's unlikely you'll spend more than $50 at one point, after all. If all else fails, contact Emergency Services on 9-1-1.\n\nWhen you're ready, dial 911, and you'll be taken through to the operator. (You won't be responsible for recording your own call.)\n\nWhen emergency services arrive\n\nThe police are here when things get tense between you and your landlord, so you have about 24 hours to get this over with. You're asked to put down any items that you're planning on taking with you, and if you're worried about your landlord letting you use a microwave, you should also check a place to pack food.\n\nOtherwise, by Monday morning, repairs could get a little messy. Just call your landlord's phone line, to try to negotiate a work plan, and keep an eye on your phone. If the landlord's line is busy, and a deal isn't reached, emergency services will probably arrive at 12:15 p.m. with no agreement, and no time to put you through to the proper person — because repairs only start once someone steps foot outside your rental building.\n\nOnce repair is complete, you're supposed to bring your stuff to a private partyroom, and you should have it cleaned up by 11:45 a.m., unless you happen to be in your car by that point.",

Now, I want to figure out how it looks like in HD. I wanted to do something with my phone when someone is dialing, or it'll look really cool if you record the call so that you can edit down and send the final edit. Also I wanted to be able to share it with my friends, family. Basically I just had to do an editing program that would just save your files to a zip or something that's just like a web site you can store the phone number in on your website and you can access it on your phone. Then I used an editor program called Audacity and I could put, say, a song or a video or lyrics. I basically just played and it's very similar to what I'm doing in software. Then I do a search engine and I kind of like to search YouTube for information about some show, for example. Then I search for \"t-rex\" or something like that and I hear the song and now I'm thinking, well, my phone needs to make a call. It could be a celebrity friend or someone that wants to know more about the car wash or something like that.\n\nIt sounds like someone was trying to make a good impression.\n\n\nA lot of people have been calling me and letting me know how hard it is. A lot of my family has also been sending me pictures of their car wash after, so I'm kind of getting all kind of a vibe. It's also fun, and I think people get a lot of enjoyment out of it, which I haven't really experienced with traditional telemarketing. It's a lot of work, it's frustrating, but it's so great and interesting.\n\nYou have different opinions than many people about the business of getting people phone numbers. Do you think that the business of calling someone down from the phone, the idea of phone calls, as they call, you get a bad vibe out there?\n\nI don't personally see it as a bad vibe as long as people have a job to do. If we were doing telephone business, you know, someone would get home and say, hey dude! Would you help me out? That's normal and kind of expected. If you need help with your carwash, that's probably a bad idea. A lot of people think that you call the person that actually did",

Can I speak for about... minute?\"\n\nBut it's not clear whether this is even remotely what you expect to hear and whether it's actually helpful, since no such recording exists for your conversation with Carwash:\n\nCarrying a weapon during an armed robbery is illegal in most states and therefore you don't have to comply.\n\nNow let's imagine this.\n\nHere's what that would look like. I got armed with a phone, but at this point the cops could also've arrested me immediately if I wanted to show that I had a weapon — just like they can't. Even after you make it sound like you don't remember telling any of the cops about Carwash's calling.\n\nWe're actually getting something like this. When we give the cops access to personal phone chats, they can even search for the conversation. After you do that, you can record the entire call to your phone and put it online. By the way, we're actually getting a recording of our conversation for you to listen to. And by the way, you don't get recorded because it's legal. You get a warrant to watch a recording for non-profit or law enforcement purposes, but police need a warrant to search your personal files after you're arrested — as long as you've already been indicted for a felony or charged with a misdemeanor.\n\nThe problem with warrantless recording is pretty much this. The reason police get this warrant is because of a new court ruling — issued today in Alabama in a murder case that will affect us all. You can read an important piece on that here.\n\nBut before we get into that legal side, let's remember that if you're innocent on the criminal charges, then you only have to prove innocence on the criminal charge, which makes you seem guilty to your lawyer. But if you're guilty on the charge, and you're the one to have done this — and the other person was just doing it as payment for Carwash's services, not because they were under threat or being paid to do anything — then the burden falls squarely on you to prove your innocence for purposes of",

The call would be recorded on a smartphone using the \"Call for Docs\" and uploaded to \"repair.org,\" according to Politico.\n\nIt is possible a recording would also be made as a document in the Trump administration's records and be uploaded online, the paper added.\n\nIt was one of more than 150 calls a day to members of the media last week by Trump, including a meeting between Trump and two ambassadors in the early afternoon.\n\nThe call was part of a wider \"pivot,\" designed to be more Trumpian with regards to the media through the use of social media, according to Politico. One tweet from Trump drew criticism from those on the left, while the president's tweets last week about leaks that embarrassed his team further alienated many Republicans.\n\nThat is only one aspect of the Trump White House — not to mention the fact that he has repeatedly tried to attack President Barack Obama or make an image of himself as a moderate and \"not a politician.\"\n\nThe problem for Washington is that both sides have been pushing back against any approach which shows Trump going too far, especially when it comes to his White House staff.\n\nBut Trump's ability to create that type of challenge has been challenged not only through a more negative public image but also within the president's core supporters for some time. Indeed, one of Obama's chief arguments during his 2008 election victory when he faced GOP challenger Hillary Clinton was that Trump didn't appear like a candidate.\n\n\"I think there's a little bit more room for nuance and nuance and nuance on some of these issues with Mr. Trump,\" a top Democratic strategist said. \"You've seen this with the way his press secretary was, trying to create a little, a little distraction. What I think we're seeing is a real reluctance to let this one person take the heat on the president in a way where he didn't intend.\"\n\n\"It's becoming more and more difficult for us as members of Congress, for the public, to have a sense from our president that we're going to get him,\" the strategist added. \"There's a perception that this isn't a Republican or a Democrat, you're trying to do this in the back rooms of the White House trying to undermine him, trying to undermine his authority.

This anonymous caller ID will be shared with the call center and called to notify the database of your changed phone number.\n\n2. Send an email invitation to the caller to return to you in order to share information about him, i.e. phone number, address and email address of the person who changed the number. The information provided from the email invitation allows for the search engine to match the email address found in the email that was sent with the requested number, i.e. to find the caller to follow up on your call. A good way to find \"anonymous\" callers would be to read up on how they used anonymous calling techniques like P.T.A. (Preferred One-Time Access). A quick note: you can avoid following up on these calls, using a private chat line or text message. 2FA has the added benefit of protecting your account when you try to use another phone number to contact someone.\n\n3. Make sure at first that the database can differentiate you from \"trusted\" calls.\n\n\nAnonymization\n\nIf you want to be protected from being found out, use multiple passcodes.\n\nYou want to be safe in the knowledge that anyone will not be able to see your number. How do you find out if someone will send you a text or email with a passcode that you cannot use? Make sure you're not receiving anything but email, not instant messages, or calls you are not on. (Here are some tips to help avoid these scenarios:\n\nDo you never have access to your phone?\n\nCan you not find out about the person calling?\n\nIn most cases, using a passcode is a better option unless the user is in the market for a new phone, or even doesn't care about who the phone person is.\n\nIf the person is on a phone call who you don't mind giving your phone number, give the text or email. This will only make sure you're not being scammed, and also will increase compliance",

In other words, you can use this as an opportunity to plan for when you will be able to run your normal (non-predictable) daily business.\n\nHow does routine maintenance work?\n\nRoutine maintenance means you're going in to a routine, usually over a short period of time, and then doing another routine that you hope to complete quickly. The \"routine\" lasts about 90 to 120 seconds.\n\nSometimes, when you run out of energy for a regular maintenance cycle, you can tell when you're low because you'll notice your breath get faster, your heart rate fall, or your skin feel rough.\n\nIf you run out more than 120 seconds before you hit or over 120 seconds longer than you normally work in your routine, the routine is a non-routine: your energy cycle is winding down.\n\nHow to run routine maintenance\n\nThe easiest way to get this type of routine is to just keep in touch with yourself in the morning and evening. Do one thing for the next day, and another thing for the next day. Sometimes you'll do two things, and one the same.\n\nFor example, you could make four short weekly visits to your home, a doctor's office, or your office to get periodic energy checks.\n\nMost routine",

You're likely to hear the sound of rubber crutching, the clattering of bits rolling down the stairs, and the rustle of paperclips as the door closes for a cup and nap. It's a simple, familiar piece of equipment, but a tool that can make repair easier and more fun for many.\n\nGet started with our Free Repairing Course\n\nHow does an old telephone do all this humming?\n\nYour phone typically has one of two sounds. The first sounds is usually your normal greeting, and you hear the signal as you call. For every 15 seconds the phone is ringing, the signal is transmitted to 1 to 10 units across your system. If each 1 unit is transmitting at about the rate of your voice, that's 2 percent of the signal. Then comes a burst, as if somebody rang up your phone.\n\nWhen the phone rings, the signal carries across all of an old telephone's network to another phone company's in one long round trip. The two phones then each attempt to relay the signal to each other to reconstruct and store new information -- as you might imagine, the information that must be lost or moved if an item is damaged. This process is called transmission, and the transmission is usually quite laggy because of this lag in phone-to-phone communication.\n\nHow does a telephone repair sound?\n\nThere are two main types of telephone repair. The first is the time and energy-intensive, and most people find it tedious and time-consuming.\n\nThe second type involves a person trying to repair the phone using a specialized repair kit that uses special materials. For example, a special repair kit may use rubber crutching to make the phone operate properly and reduce electrical noise. Each item that ends up on a phone repair table should come with the instruction manual that's provided with each telephone.\n\nWhy does the repair sound so much less pleasing than its counterpart?\n\nHow the phone operates is all a function of how the phones was built. The original telephone can be a rugged piece of wood and metal, although more recently, the computer chip and electronics in newer phones are more resistant to electronic damage and damage from heat, so the phone itself probably didn't work much for a long time--even for most people. (An older phone with the typical components will only have the electronics working, just the phone itself.)\n\nThe old telephone that you use for repair is made using metal and",

Any function that receives parameters is accessible to the caller that started it. The global server will usually be a node in the graph where RRTL::HOST can detect connections to local servers. Parameters include:\n\nglobal_server | global_port | global_time | RRTL::VIRTUAL_DEVICE_PORT | RRTVET_TIME_TIMESTAMP | RRTL_PROCESS_LIST | RRTL_PORT | RRTVET_DATA_SIZE\n\nIf an external remote client already has a global server, but is using the local server, or the connection in question is not established, it sends a client request on the local server: for example, if the user logs in with a password of \"admin\" then the RRTL::CLIENT_CATEGORY or RRTL_ACCESS_HOST is set to \"admin\"\n\nA client request is considered a connection if all the following conditions hold: The RPC endpoint that the remote client connects to has the same name as the network interface that has an active connection for the session;\n\nThe RRTL::RUN_DESKTOP setting is set to \"off\"; The RTL protocol is enabled;\n\nThe RRTL::GLOBAL_STATE setting is set to \"off\"; and that RRTL::CMD is set as above.",

Remember, it's in this XML file that the commands, commands-to-find, searching and even installation of Microsoft Windows services are executed!\n\nCreating a Restore Point on an Active Directory server\n\nThe Restore Point script contains a script that runs two functions: Check for backups and then Create a copy of data on a remote PC. This script is in.ps1 format so that you can easily find it in the same folder as the original PowerShell script. Open the console with 'PgUp' and 'PgDn' (Shift-Enter). In the command prompt, open Windows PowerShell or Start>Run dialog box and navigate to where you created the Restore Point script and click the \"Create New\". Then, in the new window that opens after you have completed the above steps, click the Create button and name the new script RestorePoint.ps1. Once the script is created, be sure where you copy this file located and then click Edit and then, if necessary, Copy. The script will read out the IP address of the computer you select. In the following example you are reading from the local computer with IP address 192.168.1.1 and in that example it uses the command below to create a backup on the device.\n\n[Microsoft SQL Server]$Computer = (\"192.168.0.1\", \"192.168.1.1\") Write-Output $Computer\n\nThis command allows you to verify where that file is located.\n\nCreating the restored data is the next step of creating the restore point that connects the computers to the back-up in the first instance. In the first instance, if the recovery was successful you will need to log into the Windows Recovery Environment that resides in the computer as root and create a password. If you use the remote recovery (Windows Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8) you will need to create an online administrator account from within that environment before you can log in.

Why haven't we heard from Mr. Sessions, as he was asked before the vote of his bill to make it illegal to \"pollute.\" Do you support banning carbon emissions?\n\nSenator Sessions: My answer to all these questions is the same, no. On my part, I certainly am of the opinion that a cleaner energy policy means going after the sources of pollution, and coal is one of them, the ones that you can't solve. I don't understand why we can't do the same thing with gas, that we've made pretty much the cleanest energy technology in history, that creates a wealth of jobs. We should be focused on that.\n\nIn the State Department, for example, we are investing $900 million and have a very successful coal mine here in West Virginia. The president's commission on clean energy is doing a great job of looking at the use of natural gas today in this country, I believe. So we still have a lot of work to do to achieve a true 100 percent clean energy future for this country. However, we can do better. We have to address both the fossil fuel-driven climate change that caused the Great Carbon Drought, and the environmental problems because every time the world goes into debt, we're creating more places where a flood can happen. All those problems are real consequences of our dependency on fossil fuels and also to get rid of the pollution.\n\nYou know, I am going to continue to believe that the cleanest sources of energy, coal and oil, are available to us; the problem is we've gotten this way. I am more convinced of the reality that an American generation can live in a world that includes alternative fuels; that we can be the clean energy that is needed to make clean clean clean smart.\n\nI understand he won't agree with me on every measure, but I really think you have a choice between having an energy revolution where we clean the planet or the dirty energy revolution that is destroying our kids' futures?\n\nCaller ID:\n\nTo what extent is Mr. Obama's commitment to protecting the environment and his environmental legacy important to you?\n\nSenator Sanders: We've come a long way in so many ways in so many ways.

It was immediately reported by the Texas Tribune:\n\nIt's now been more than a month since then and we're not yet hearing the final word in that one. … The spill has been a big and urgent concern since yesterday when the EPA issued documents regarding the pipeline to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. EPA issued the documents to the tribes as they consider the safety of the pipeline, and the tribe has come forward in hopes that it will help its case, with the document showing details of the impact of the spill, spill response plans prepared by BP and other companies and reports from the Corps of Engineers. Still, none of this has appeared in an upcoming oil spill cleanup order from the EPA. In other words, we don't have any information about spill response plans or the EPA plans to handle cleanup after the spill that is being reviewed by the tribes. And we're not even hearing from those tribes about where the actual spill is located or what measures will be taken if the spill isn't cleaned up.\n\nWhile the story on the Standing Rock Sioux tribe was first reported by the Energy & Environment Daily Report, there is good news to be found in it. The latest Energy and Environment Daily Report reveals what a lot of us were hoping the last time:",

In our example, we created a digital recording and set the file type as an audio file. We recorded the call at 3:23PM on October 18, 2014, using the device from above and left the recording on the phone for three minutes. We also wrote down the duration, the call point (and call source) and time (in minutes).\n\nOnce you're done with the recording, you have two options to compare notes on your phone. The first option allows you to choose the best time of day for the conversation. The second option allows you to compare notes from the call where the first option fails (\"I can't hear her\") and the call where the second option succeeds (\"I can hear her\"). Our experiment yielded the best results in the first case, especially if the call was from 2:35 PM to 2:44 PM on October 17, 2014; this gives us the highest accuracy (a better signal strength for these calls).\n\nWhat happens if we try to compare from the second call? What if there is another conversation going on next? If the conversations are from 3:20PM to 3:39PM on October 20, 2014, the results are the same as if we had only created it from a digital recording but added another recording at 8:24 PM. If you're on mobile devices as well, this may be possible if you change the file type to an audio file.\n\nThe second time we created this recording, we changed the file type to a 5-minute audio file. We decided the best time to record had already been set (time 5:22 PM); the third time we recorded (call 3:23 PM) had already been set so we could compare our results in that case. If we try a third time, we have a slightly lower signal strength in both of the other cases.\n\nIf you're trying to use the second call as an alternative to recording the rest of your phone conversations as a reference for the second best time, note that we recorded the call from 2:34 PM to 2:42 PM. What happens if the second conversation comes after the first and has the same conversation?\n\nWhy is the audio from the first call more likely to be better? Remember, we said that the second call has a better signal strength when the phone is older. In most of these cases, the phone has",

First, you'll want to know how to build a transcript. A transcription can be built in any of the following ways:\n\nA text editor that has text-to-speech support to create, type, and convert the transcription into text.\n\nCachet (also known as a transcription generator).\n\nSome type-ahead text-to-speech features such as Auto-complete or autocorrect feature.\n\nAn alternative language-based (or transcoded in) tool for editing text.\n\nHow to Build a Transcript: Part 1\n\nA transcript can be an easily used transcription tool and is often available in the following languages on Google services:\n\nSpanish.\n\nPortuguese.\n\nGerman.\n\nItalian.\n\nThe English language is also a popular setting for a transcription but only accessible via Google, Yahoo, and MSN Transcription service.\n\nHow to Build a Transcript: Part 2\n\nText-to-speech (TTS) software such as Acrobole or Verint is a popular choice among transcription developers.\n\nThe most common method of constructing a TTS transcript is the simple way to generate a 3- to 4-minute transcript using just the text field – you simply need to select the text field from the list of text that you want to get a transcript for.\n\nThe program will generate the 5-minute transcript, and you'll need to enter a transcript into the text field. Your software will then give you a link to either the generated 3- to 4-minute transcript or you can click on the link, and you'll be taken to a specific web page where you can download the completed transcript. Most importantly, the transcript will automatically begin and end when you click the link.\n\nHere is how easy it is to create a 3- to 4-minute TTS transcript in the Google Translate and Google Translate for Android apps. If you use the English language app, you will have several options to adjust the length of the call. First, you can set the length of the broadcast, which is set by the length of the words of that call, and the second option is how the transcriber's pronunciation is formatted so that you can convert the pronunciation to your language's standard speech.

If that doesn't impress you, nothing does. Oil is selling for over $100 a barrel. How much do you think that is? Are you prepared for that? If the oil industry starts growing and you do not foresee growth, how much do you think they are going to spend in the next 10 years?\n\nSo if you have an increase in business, you expect that revenue to increase with that change, so it won't be a drop in the bucket. Now, the oil industry does have a big problem when it comes to keeping workers to maintain its businesses, and the one thing it will have trouble with is that you're now starting to cut workers. We've heard that the industry is making up the slack at the oil patch, but that's not true. This job loss is coming even with the oil market going up. And there have been reports of oil rigs going into water bodies as many as 12 feet underground; and that's happening now across the country. So what these guys just said, we've already come to our estimate on wages. Now, what kind of jobs don't you guys think will get cut?\n\nThen from people who have a lot of money in the industry to people that are unemployed, do you believe the oil patches will continue to get better as we grow? Now, this is a pretty big question. You've got this number, but we're in a transitional period right now. In the last 10 years, we've added 1 million workers to this economy. But what kind of jobs could you bring back into the job market if you really didn't have a lot of spending? Now here is one area where money is tight. You got money that people were able to take with them overseas without taking any job. You've got these people who have come here after going through a very tough economic time and are looking for a good job or maybe not so good. And these are the people that are going to be in our community and our communities. And even with the boom so far, people have been losing their jobs when it comes to the oil patch. So you want that kind of money to grow in the future so that we can",

There is nothing wrong with being attractive, but there are definitely times when you need to take control yourself.\n\nThe two basic things to know are:\n\n1) You may never speak to somebody in order to talk to them\n\n2) Every single one of us has some time when we wish we hadn't in order to say a simple thing to a girl who has taken it upon themselves to listen, like how many friends do you have, how many dates have you had, etc. They're just that kind of person.\n\nFor example: I would never call my friend, \"What's working for you and how do you like",

Just make sure you check what store in question (remember how you did it?) before you do this, but they do not require you to enter your ID or password before you use the transcript; this is great if you do not always have multiple stores in the same city. It gets even more complicated when you need to check in multiple locations, since you must check in the store you buy the product from. This can be very problematic. It may be better to have your product or service at multiple locations than at once, if that is easy for you to access.\n\nHere are all my tips for preparing for a Car-for-hire:\n\nNote your Location on Your CTA Call\n\nIf you want to make sure you are on a consistent route—you cannot know when it's likely your product and/or service will be delivered, yet. So take notes of where you are when your CTA turns into your actual destination, either by moving around a store in your vicinity or by walking down the street or to a different store—and note how you arrive at that location.\n\nIf your CTA is in the area you want to pick up your item. Make it known on any phone call that your item is in that particular store, or when it will be picked up.\n\nBe specific in your request for the purchase—it's okay if your CTA says you want to pick up this product or service in that area. Be sure to clearly indicate what your item will cost, and explain what you expect to obtain for it, for example where may or cannot pick it up.\n\nGive a brief description of the need/demand you have in your area. How important will the item be in your area (will it be a necessary service or something you may just buy and return) before you call? How likely is it that your item is the first in or the last out?\n\nTalk about how you can reach you for advice.\n\nHow to Communicate your Own Sales Demand to Other Retailers in Your Area\n\nAnother thing you can do to increase the chances you won't be picked to pick up your product at a particular store: you can communicate that your \"demand\" is from your own store that you currently shop at, but it's just very specific to the area and you may",
